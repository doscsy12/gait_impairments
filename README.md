## Gait variations in elderly with different forms of impairment

### Background
A normal gait depends upon normal functioning of the nervous, muscular, skeletal, circulatory and respiratory systems in a highly coordinated and integrated manner. Injury or disease of one or more of these systems may lead to impairment of gait and consequently reduce a personâ€™s mobility. 

This study is in two parts. First, gait analysis was performed on elderly participants affected by different gait impairments. The following presents a representation of a patient's gait patterns affected by aging, or other diseases affecting the neuromuscular system. 
Next, simulation of the gait patterns were performed using [Vicon BodyBuilder](https://www.vicon.com/software/bodybuilder/) and [LifeForms](http://www.credo-interactive.com/products/lifeforms/lf_4-0_studio.html). Namely, motion files were created in Bodybuilder, and Life Forms was used to edit and blend the motion capture in sequences.
